# MKID Detect

Inspired by [emccd_detect](https://github.com/roman-corgi/emccd_detect/tree/master/emccd_detect)
and the [MKID Pipeline](https://github.com/roman-corgi/emccd_detect/tree/master/emccd_detect),
for a given input flux map mkid_detect will return a simulated MKID photon list saved to an HDF5 file.

MKID data by nature can be quite memory intensive so caution should be taken to ensure memory
issues are not encountered.
